# vidya-guide
Building **VidyaGuide** as a pure HTML frontend integrated with Firebase is a smart move for fast deployment. This architecture keeps your costs at zero (within free tiers) and makes the site incredibly fast since it's "serverless."

Here is your revised project plan tailored for a **Firebase + Vercel** deployment.

---

## 🛠️ Phase 1: Tech Stack & Project Structure

Since you want easy deployment on Vercel, we will use a **Vanilla JS / Modular** approach. Vercel will host your static files (HTML/CSS/JS), and Firebase will act as your "Backend-as-a-Service."

### Folder Structure

```text
vidyaguide-ai/
├── public/
│   ├── index.html       <-- Landing & Login
│   ├── dashboard.html   <-- Main AI Analysis Area
│   ├── styles.css       <-- Custom UI
│   └── app.js           <-- Firebase Logic & API Calls
├── .env                 <-- API Keys (Local testing)
├── vercel.json          <-- Vercel Config
└── README.md

```

## 🔐 Phase 2: Firebase Integration

You will use Firebase for two things: **Authentication** (Logins) and **Firestore** (Database to save user history).

1. **Google Login:** Enable "Google" in the Firebase Auth console.
2. **Firestore:** Create a collection called `analyses` to store resume results.
3. **Security Rules:** Set rules so users can only read/write their own data (`request.auth.uid == resource.data.userId`).

---

## 🧠 Phase 3: AI Integration (The Mentor)

Since this is a frontend-heavy project, you have two choices for the AI:

* **Direct API Call (Quickest):** Call the Gemini/OpenAI API directly from your `app.js`.
* **Vercel Serverless Function (Most Secure):** Place the API call in a small script in an `/api` folder. This prevents your API key from being visible in the browser's "Inspect Element."

> **Warning:** Never hardcode your API key in `index.html`. Always use Vercel's **Environment Variables** dashboard.

---

## 🚀 Phase 4: Implementation Roadmap (4 Steps)

### 1. Setup Firebase SDK

In your `index.html`, include the Firebase modules:

```html
<script type="module">
  import { initializeApp } from "https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/10.x/firebase-app.js";
  import { getAuth, signInWithPopup, GoogleAuthProvider } from "https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/10.x/firebase-auth.js";

  const firebaseConfig = { /* Your Config Here */ };
  const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
  const auth = getAuth(app);
</script>

```

### 2. Build the Resume Parser

Use `pdf-lib` or a simple text-extraction library to read the PDF content directly in the browser.

### 3. Design the Dashboard

Use a modern CSS framework like **Tailwind CSS** (via CDN for simplicity) to create a "Mentor Dashboard" that shows:

* **Skill Gap Meter:** A visual progress bar of how "Job-Ready" the user is.
* **Improvement List:** 3–5 bullet points generated by the AI.

### 4. Deploy to Vercel

1. Push your code to **GitHub**.
2. Import the repo into **Vercel**.
3. **Crucial:** Go to *Settings > Environment Variables* and add your `GEMINI_API_KEY` and Firebase config there.

## 📈 Social & Business Impact

* **For Students:** High impact by providing free, instant feedback usually reserved for expensive career coaches.
* **For Colleges:** Can be white-labeled for placement cells to track student readiness.

**Would you like me to provide the specific HTML/JS code for the Firebase "Google Login" button to get you started?**
